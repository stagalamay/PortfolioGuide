| [AIComprehend: An Adaptive Reading Comprehension Learning Platform Using Machine Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323847) | My college thesis. A machine learning-based online platform whose objective is to improve the English reading comprehension of its users using an adaptive learning approach. | python |
| [Message Obfuscation](https://github.com/stagalamay/MessageObfuscation) |  A system that transforms readable text into an obfuscated format using a custom esolang (diropql) and layered encoding (BWT â†’ MTF â†’ RLE â†’ Base85). Designed for reversible obfuscation with metadata handling, it showcases low-level data transformation, custom language design, and encoding pipelines. | rust |
| [Error Correction](https://github.com/stagalamay/ErrorCorrection) | A Python implementation of a Reed-Solomon-inspired error correction algorithm over the finite field GF(929). It detects and corrects transmission errors using syndrome computation, the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, and Chien searchâ€”showcasing practical skills in finite field arithmetic and algorithm design. | python |
| [Poverty Predictor](https://github.com/stagalamay/PovertyPredictorModel) | Logistic Regression was used to make this model. Showcases techniques used for data preparation, feature analysis, logistic regression, and model evaluation. | python |
